# Sort by Field

A Joomla 4.2 or later plugin to sort the articles in a category by the value of a custom field.

This is useful when making a category of events where the event date is stored in a Joomla! custom field. Create a menu
item for the category (list or blog view) and set it to order by the value of the event date custom field ascending.
Archive past events. Create another menu item to show only archived articles and set it to sort by the event date custom
field descending. There you go! You now have a quick'n'dirty event calendar using core Joomla features.

I wrote this plugin because I needed it. Also, the use case I had presented back in 2015 in the (literal) round table
discussion regarding Joomla 4 features with regard to custom fields was exactly that: a quick and dirty event calendar!
It's sad that Joomla decided to add custom fields but not make it possible to sort or filter by them. This plugin gets
the custom fields closer to my original vision of the feature and the possibilities it opens for site integrators.
